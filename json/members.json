Jeg er eventmager og historiefortæller og jeg mener at rollespil skal være sjovt, lærerigt, udfordrende - og en lille smule uhyggeligt. Både for børn og voksne",

I like to plan and make great experiences for children, so why not combine it with something you are passionate about for? Role play, the slightly nerdy and weird, as well as fun with the kids both inside and out. ",

Completely inexperienced, I threw myself, perhaps therefore naturally enough, into role-playing, exceeded a limit or two, and have now for years enjoyed myself. with all the wonderful adults and children in Fafner, both as a deputy, but also as a lot of creatures / personalities. In addition to the live role-playing game itself, I have loved making physical scenery and soundscapes.",
