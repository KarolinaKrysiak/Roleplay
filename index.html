        Fafner Fight Club is our combat training. We meet once a week, specifically Mondays from 5pm to 6pm, and fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        We train combat with the soft role-playing weapons that everyone knows, but also a number of other forms of
        combat. It can be anything from stunt fight, over kendo and bartitsu to steel guns and wooden shields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course we take care of each other and wear appropriate protective equipment.

    </div>

    <div class="parallax" id="f1"></div>

    <div class="article-element">
      <p>
        The fight club is open to all members of Fafner role-playing games. Bring training clothes, a water bottle and
        preferably also some gloves of some kind (the fingers are always exposed and it hurts much less to get a rap
        over the teddy bears if you have gloves on) If you have your own weapons with you, it's fine, otherwise borrow
        one just of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crucial part of role-playing is collaboration. In Fafner we want cultivate cooperation and team-player
        mindset. It helps young people develop socially as well as individually. By learning how to cooperate one
        acquires problem-solving skills, learns how to resolve conflicts and stand for one's values and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well met!

        Martial arts are an excellent way to gain body experience. Coordination, balance, agility and strength are
        developed through combat training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further intensify the struggle experience of joy, excitement, thrill, pride, self-control, body awareness and
        self-belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        You stand face to face to find out who is the strongest, has the best balance or reacts the fastest. With that
        understanding, you create the basis for the fights not to become too serious. It should be fun and exciting to
        fight with each other and both parties meet with respect.
      </p>

        Today's studies show that it is possible to reduce children's and teenagers' aggression and negative behavior
        through martial arts. This type of physical activity helps them release their natural energy and have a lot of
        fun at the same time. Martian arts also play a very important role of a self-discipline development of a person
        and teaches about controlling one's emotions.
      </p>

        And remember: In Fafner, children win over adults! -Almost every time :-)

        tend to participate in the youth and leisure clubs' Big Role-playing Day in Skanderborg. In addition, we run a
        team of "the big ones" to Sunfall and we have a dream of participating together in one of the big European
        role-playing games such as Mythodea in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want a mix of our own live role-playing games and getting out and participating in others. Both to learn
        something new and because live role-playing games are simply fun when there are many involved.
      </p>

        We also do workshops and workshops where we repair the equipment and build new ones. It can be anything from
        suits, to leather armor, masks, weapons, car tires, shields or whatever we just need for the next game. (there
        was even once someone who sat and sewed a belt holder for a fine porcelain teacup with saucer intended to be
        able to pull like a cowboy in a shooting duel. (it was something with some steampunk cosplay)
      </p>
      <p>
        We also make sure to keep the fighting form at bay until medieval role-playing games. For that purpose we have
        Fafner Fight Club (and yes you can talk about it) where we train all kinds of combat and stunts.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of us are definite experts, but we learn from each other and have fun and get some exercise in the
        meantime. We fight mostly with the soft role-playing weapons, but we also have both steel and wooden weapons at
        our disposal.

      <p>
        Do you want to play? Of course!
      </p>
      <p>
        Playing is important for children, young people and adults alike. In the game, we experiment, get creative and
        experience the possibilities of the world. In short: the game helps to develop everything we want to develop:
        Robustness, creativity, innovation, curiosity and social skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagination is a cornerstone of any role-playing game. Unfortunately, we can not do real magic, but at the
        playing arena we all agree that when "Black Eye" is shouted, everyone who hears the shout goes blind for 30
        seconds. They roam around and shout and scream in anxiety and many panic around with weapons. Meanwhile, the
        Necromancer lists just as quietly. Imagination maximizes the brain's resources and ability to process,
        transform, and transcend - imagination is to create something new.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="parallax" id="l3"></div>

    <div class="article-element">
      <p>
        When a child, for example, meets an evil, super scary and combative orc and then presents himself as a noble,
        brave and cunning Black Queen, the child will as silently as possible try to sneak into the adult and loudly
        perform his declaration of war served with a storm of well-aimed swords and the magic of "black eyes".
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the child knows well that it is not really a Black Queen and that the other is not a chore, but the
        imagination in the game allows the child to test a number of hypotheses for what would happen if it really was a
        queen who stood face to face with his malevolent arch-rival
      </p>
      <p>
        After the game, they can meet and have a fun game together. An experience that they will hopefully develop and
        play with again.

        D&D, Shadowrun, Call of Chtuhlu, Dragons and Demons, World of Darkness, Viking, and so on and so forth. The list

      </p>
      <p>
        For those who are not exactly into it, table role-playing games are a form of board games - just without boards.
        This is done by creating a character (= a character) who then has to interact into a story that is told by a
        game leader. It can be anything from being a proud knight who has to go out and save beautiful princesses from
        dragons (or save dragons from terrible princes, if that is), that you are a private detective in the 1920s USA
        and have to solve occult mysteries, or that one is a member of a vampire clan in 1980s Paris and must fight his
        way to the pinnacle of power within the clan.

        that he exhales under the dragon's claws and must start again with a new character
      </p>

        It has been a confusing and stormy time for the small kingdom of Niebelungen. But now the peace seems to have
        subsided. At least for a while. The dragon Fafner was greatly weakened displaced and probably licks his wounds
        far from the borders of Niebelungen and Death and his army is again locked inside the darkest cave.

      <p>
        After the battle against Death and the Dragon Fafner, the ancient gods are loved like never before, and
        therefore return strengthened. But peace, as you know, is only a brief build-up between two wars.

      </p>

      <p>A ghost walks through the Kingdom of Niebelungen, the Ghost of the King of Thieves. In every marketplace, this
        mysterious figure is whispered about. The thief king has long been a legend in Niebelungen, something suspicious
        people used to scare their children with. "If you stick your father to the city guard, the twenty king will come
        and take you !!" or as a kind of bohemian one could blame if a servant lost his master's money "No gentlemen, I
        have not been to Kro, it must be the King of Thieves who is behind" But lately the fear has become more and more
        tangible. Robber gangs now speak openly about the mysterious Thief King to whom they pay taxes, but also feel
        protected by. And burglary, robberies and assaults have become part of the order of the day both in the 4
        cities, in the forest and on the roads. In short, Niebelungen now lives in fear of the Thief King.
      </p>

      <p>In the cities themselves, things are not going too well, because the nobility is fighting. Baron von Rothenburg
        returns home from a expedition in anticipation of honor and glory. Instead, he discovers that his possessions
        lie in ruins, the worst of what has happened in his absence is that the deed at Ligthenheim has been sold. The
        sale has taken place in more or less shady forms, and has something to do with the baron's trusted bodyguard
        Sch√∂ntz.
      </p>

      <p>The new owner is Goblinen Kromutter, who cannot quite explain the change of ownership in a convincing way and
        has therefore fallen into disfavor among the nobility. Kromutter, however, tends to have a faithful flock of
        nomads and lost soldiers as his bodyguard, the problem with them is that they usually fall for rum and gold and
        let themselves be bought over to another gentlemen. Chrome nut, however, is never completely lost, she knows
        magic and many are afraid of her power.
      </p>

      <p>Welcome to Niebelungen no. XXV. </p>

        <h3>Kongeriget Niebelungen </h3>
        <h5>A continued role-playing campaign</h5>
      </div>
      <p>Nibelungen is a small and legendary kingdom, which nowadays is only connected to the human world via a portal,
        which at certain intervals manifests itself in the town Bjedstrup which is located between Skanderborg and Ry in
        Denmark.
      </p>
      <p>Niebelungen is trapped in a time pocket, which in human time matches the period between the German-Roman
        emperor Charlemagne (also known as Charlemagne - died 814) and Emperor Charles the 5th (died 1556).
      </p>
      <p>It is in the period when the original genera of the Old World slowly but surely retreat from the visible,
        human-dominated world and disappear into the mists of legend.
      </p>
      <p>Charles the 5th is thus the last human emperor who has seen and spoken with an elven prince and with a dwarf
        king. This happened when the elven prince Wolfric and the dwarf king Albrecht participated in Charles'
        coronation as German-Roman emperor in the year 1530 - ie. in the time just before the Reformation ran through
        Europe and forever changed by the old and well-established customs and finally tore the bond between the human
        world and the old world. Since then, the original genera of the Old World have not been seen or heard in the
        human world.
      </p>
      <p>Only through the Nibelungen is it still possible to meet the ancient original genera:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ambitious and diverse - people
        </li>
        <li> The skilled blacksmiths and fearless warriors - the dwarves
        </li>
        <li> The proud and beautiful rivers
        </li>
        <li>The grim and raw goblins and orcs
        </li>
        <li> The friendly and cheerful, but also cunning and cunning hobbits
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Nibelungen is thus a kingdom that does not follow the reckoning of time that is valid in our world. Being
        trapped in a time pocket therefore means that in Niebelungen you see costumes, weapons, art and customs that
        span from the Viking Age's heyday to the High Middle Ages just before the Reformation. Here you have the
        opportunity to live out your dreams of fighting deadly knights, practicing magic, helping to rule a kingdom or
        blackmailing thugs and undermining the rule of others of a kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>One can also build a trading empire, brew and sell potions and other miracle cures, practice a craft as a
        blacksmith or baker, and earn a fortune. Only your imagination sets the limits.
      </p>

        <h3>Niebelungen</h3>
        <h5>History and Geography</h5>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the early days, Niebelungen was a united kingdom under the mighty King Charles the Bald - a warrior king by
        the grace of the gods, who united the kingdom and ensured peace in the land for as long as he lived. He ruled
        with an iron fist in the velvet glove and was also a master at keeping the various factions and genera in check
        and playing them off against each other if it drew up to disagreements.
      </p>
      <p>
        To further strengthen the unity, Charles adopted a young man from each of the ruling families: an elven prince,
        a son of an orc prince, and a human child, raising them as his own sons.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when Karl died, the unity was over. Karl's adopted sons individually demanded to be recognized as the new
        king of the entire Niebelungen - but as neither of them could muster an army large enough to seriously overcome
        both of the other two factions - the Nibelungen ended up being divided into three city-states, which have since
        been embroiled in strife

      <h3>Newsletter</h3>
      <p>K√¶re Venner<br><br>
        Vi er s√• klar efter alt for lang tid uden rollespil. Vi har igen live events plus Fafner Fight Club p√• menuen.
        Det bliver lidt anderledes end vi er vant til pga. ..ja, I ved.<br><br>
        S√∏ndag den 9. maj og den 13. juni genoptager vi vores eget klassisk fantasy univers kaldet ‚ÄùNiebelungen‚Äù hvor
        man kan opleve s√¶re v√¶sner, sjove opgaver, m√¶rkelige skrifter og drabelige slag. Her kan alle v√¶re med, det
        anbefales dog at b√∏rn under 2. klasse kommer if√∏lge med voksne, da der sandsynligvis er uhyrer i skoven!
        <br><br>
        Niebelungen finder sted hver den anden s√∏ndag i m√•neden og ud over her p√• hjemmesiden kan man ogs√• l√¶se
        historien, f√∏lge med i udviklingen, f√• spor og trailere osv. p√• Fafners facebook gruppeside<br><br>
        Niebelungen spillene koster penge at deltage i , 80 kr for ikke medlemmer og 20 kr for medlemmer, selvom der
        st√•r gratis p√• facebook begivenheden.<br><br>
        Mandag den 12. april genstarter Fafner Fight Club som vores kamptr√¶ning. Vi m√∏des en gang om ugen, n√¶rmere
        bestemt mandage fra 17 til 18, og sl√•s.<br><br>
        Vi tr√¶ner kamp med de bl√∏de rollespilsv√•ben i alle sammen kender, men ogs√• en del andre kampformer. Det kan v√¶re
        alt fra stuntkamp , over kendo og bartitsu til st√•lv√•ben og tr√¶skjolde. Vi passer selvf√∏lgelig p√• hinanden og
        b√¶re passende beskyttelses udstyr.<br><br>
        Fightclubben er √•ben for alle medlemmer af Fafner rollespil. Medbring tr√¶nings t√∏j, drikkedunk og gerne ogs√•
        nogle<br><br>
        hansker af en eller anden slags (fingrene er altid udsatte og det g√•r v√¶sentligt mindre ondt at f√• et rap over
        nallerne hvis man har hansker p√•) Hvis man har egne v√•ben med er det fint, ellers l√•ner man bare af os.<br><br>
        Normalerweize (uden corona restriktioner) holder Fafner forskellige workshops,<br><br>
        bordrollespil, br√¶tspilsdage og -aftner/n√¶tter for vores medlemmer. Og kan man selv samle en gruppe er man
        velkommen til at l√•ne HQ.<br><br>
        Og ja: De voksne i Fafner m√∏des ind i mellem og spille poker, hjerterfri og blackjack. Og nej vi spiller ikke om
        penge - kun √¶ren.<br><br>
        Ud over det allerede n√¶vnte; har vi faktisk ogs√• et par One Shot arrangementer til jer i efter√•ret.<br><br>
        Vi f√•r brug for al den hj√¶lp vi kan f√• til det her da formen kr√¶ver nogle flere spilledere/voksne end vi er vant
        til, s√• hvis der sidder nogle for√¶ldre derude som har lyst til at gi' en h√•nd s√• hold jer endelig ikke tilbage.
        <br><br>
        Skriv til johan@kirstinelund.dk hvis i har lyst til at lege med<br><br>
        Vi har k√∏rt meget af vores kommunikation igennem facebook p√• det sidste og vi ved godt at det ikke n√∏dvendigvis
        er
        den smarteste m√•de at n√• ud til alle p√•. Derfor har vi lavet en ny hjemmeside til foreningen.<br><br>
        Vi ses
        Vh Johan<br><br>
        Formand for Fafner Rollespil
