    <p>We train combat with the soft role-playing weapons that everyone knows, but also a number of other forms of combat. It can be anything from stunt fight, over kendo and bartitsu to steel guns and wooden shields.    </p>

    <h3>LARP</h3>
<p>A large part of Fafner's activities is about live role-playing. We have our regular campaign, the Neibelungen and a few annual one-day or one-of-a-kind scenarios. We often participate in Stjær role-playing events and also tend to participate in the youth and leisure clubs' Big Role-playing Day in Skanderborg.</p>

<p>In Fafner Roleplaying, we hold introductory workshops in table roleplaying and we have a few different groups running. We encourage our members to form groups that can meet once in a while and we are happy to make rooms, coffee, dice and game books available for game groups.

        <h3>Workshops</h3>
<p>We hold many different workshops during the year under the auspices of Fafner. Some of these workshops are targeted at specific role-playing games, for example Sunfall or Quarantine Europe others are more general and can be about learning to work with leather, building weapons or costumes or modifying your favorite nerve from ugly plastic toys to the ultimate Flash Gordon jet gun.

          Fafner Fight Club is our combat training. We meet once a week, specifically Mondays from 5pm to 6pm, and fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We train combat with the soft role-playing weapons that everyone knows, but also a number of other forms of combat. It can be anything from stunt fight, over kendo and bartitsu to steel guns and wooden shields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course we take care of each other and wear appropriate protective  equipment.
        </p>

      <div class="parallax f1"></div>

      <div class="article-element">
        <p>
          The fight club is open to all members of Fafner role-playing games. Bring training clothes, a water bottle and preferably also some gloves of some kind (the fingers are always exposed and it hurts much less to get a rap over the teddy bears if you have gloves on) If you have your own weapons with you, it's fine, otherwise borrow one just of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          A crucial part of role-playing is collaboration. In Fafner we want cultivate cooperation and team-player mindset. It helps young people develop socially as well as individually. By learning how to cooperate one acquires problem-solving skills, learns how to resolve conflicts and stand for one's values and opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well met!

          Martial arts are an excellent way to gain body experience. Coordination, balance, agility and strength are developed through combat training.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further intensify the struggle experience of joy, excitement, thrill, pride, self-control, body awareness and self-belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          You stand face to face to find out who is the strongest, has the best balance or reacts the fastest. With that understanding, you create the basis for the fights not to become too serious. It should be fun and exciting to fight with each other and both parties meet with respect.
        </p>

          Today's studies show that it is possible to reduce children's and teenagers' aggression and negative behavior through martial arts. This type of physical activity helps them release their natural energy and have a lot of fun at the same time. Martian arts also play a very important role of a self-discipline development of a person and teaches about controlling one's emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And remember: In Fafner, children win over adults! -Almost every time :-)
