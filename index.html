          Fafner Fight Club is our combat training. We meet once a week, specifically Mondays from 5pm to 6pm, and fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We train combat with the soft role-playing weapons that everyone knows, but also a number of other forms of combat. It can be anything from stunt fight, over kendo and bartitsu to steel guns and wooden shields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course we take care of each other and wear appropriate protective  equipment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="parallax" id="f1"></div>

      <div class="article-element">
        <p>
          The fight club is open to all members of Fafner role-playing games. Bring training clothes, a water bottle and preferably also some gloves of some kind (the fingers are always exposed and it hurts much less to get a rap over the teddy bears if you have gloves on) If you have your own weapons with you, it's fine, otherwise borrow one just of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          A crucial part of role-playing is collaboration. In Fafner we want cultivate cooperation and team-player mindset. It helps young people develop socially as well as individually. By learning how to cooperate one acquires problem-solving skills, learns how to resolve conflicts and stand for one's values and opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well met!

          Martial arts are an excellent way to gain body experience. Coordination, balance, agility and strength are developed through combat training.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further intensify the struggle experience of joy, excitement, thrill, pride, self-control, body awareness and self-belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          You stand face to face to find out who is the strongest, has the best balance or reacts the fastest. With that understanding, you create the basis for the fights not to become too serious. It should be fun and exciting to fight with each other and both parties meet with respect.
        </p>

          Today's studies show that it is possible to reduce children's and teenagers' aggression and negative behavior through martial arts. This type of physical activity helps them release their natural energy and have a lot of fun at the same time. Martian arts also play a very important role of a self-discipline development of a person and teaches about controlling one's emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And remember: In Fafner, children win over adults! -Almost every time :-)

    A large part of Fafner's activities is about live role-playing. We have our regular campaign, the Neibelungen and a few annual one-day or one-of-a-kind scenarios. We often participate in Stjær role-playing events and also tend to participate in the youth and leisure clubs' Big Role-playing Day in Skanderborg. In addition, we run a team of "the big ones" to Sunfall and we have a dream of participating together in one of the big European role-playing games such as Mythodea in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
    We want a mix of our own live role-playing games and getting out and participating in others. Both to learn something new and because live role-playing games are simply fun when there are many involved.
  </p>

    We also do workshops and workshops where we repair the equipment and build new ones. It can be anything from suits, to leather armor, masks, weapons, car tires, shields or whatever we just need for the next game. (there was even once someone who sat and sewed a belt holder for a fine porcelain teacup with saucer intended to be able to pull like a cowboy in a shooting duel. (it was something with some steampunk cosplay)
  </p>
  <p>
    We also make sure to keep the fighting form at bay until medieval role-playing games. For that purpose we have Fafner Fight Club (and yes you can talk about it) where we train all kinds of combat and stunts.
  </p>
  <p>
    None of us are definite experts, but we learn from each other and have fun and get some exercise in the meantime. We fight mostly with the soft role-playing weapons, but we also have both steel and wooden weapons at our disposal.
  </p>

<div class="parallax" id="l2"></div>

    Do you want to play? Of course!
  </p>
  <p>
    Playing is important for children, young people and adults alike. In the game, we experiment, get creative and experience the possibilities of the world. In short: the game helps to develop everything we want to develop: Robustness, creativity, innovation, curiosity and social skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagination is a cornerstone of any role-playing game. Unfortunately, we can not do real magic, but at the playing arena we all agree that when "Black Eye" is shouted, everyone who hears the shout goes blind for 30 seconds. They roam around and shout and scream in anxiety and many panic around with weapons. Meanwhile, the Necromancer lists just as quietly. Imagination maximizes the brain's resources and ability to process, transform, and transcend - imagination is to create something new.
  </p>

<div class="parallax" id="l3"></div>

<div class="article-element">
  <p>
    When a child, for example, meets an evil, super scary and combative orc and then presents himself as a noble, brave and cunning Black Queen, the child will as silently as possible try to sneak into the adult and loudly perform his declaration of war served with a storm of well-aimed swords and the magic of "black eyes".
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, the child knows well that it is not really a Black Queen and that the other is not a chore, but the imagination in the game allows the child to test a number of hypotheses for what would happen if it really was a queen who stood face to face with his malevolent arch-rival
  </p>
  <p>
    After the game, they can meet and have a fun game together. An experience that they will hopefully develop and play with again.

          D&D, Shadowrun, Call of Chtuhlu, Dragons and Demons, World of Darkness, Viking, and so on and so forth. The list of role-playing games is long and behind each title hides new worlds and new experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who are not exactly into it, table role-playing games are a form of board games - just without boards. This is done by creating a character (= a character) who then has to interact into a story that is told by a game leader. It can be anything from being a proud knight who has to go out and save beautiful princesses from dragons (or save dragons from terrible princes, if that is), that you are a private detective in the 1920s USA and have to solve occult mysteries, or that one is a member of a vampire clan in 1980s Paris and must fight his way to the pinnacle of power within the clan.

          It may be the character survives the hardships and wins honors, money and prestige, but it is equally possible that he exhales under the dragon's claws and must start again with a new character
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it is only the imagination that sets the limits - and life and death are decided by a roll of the dice.

          For our workshops for children members, you must have an adult with you. This means that you can really achieve something on such a workshop day and then it is always nice to do something together. There is a small own payment on the expensive materials such as core leather etc. This means that you come home with a pair of arm protectors for approx. a 50s or a finished shield for a 20s
